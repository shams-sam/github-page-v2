<h3 id="discourse-analysis">Discourse Analysis</h3>

<p>Discourse Analysis or discourse studies is a general term used for a number of approaches used to analyze written, vocal, or sign language use, or any semiotic event.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Semiotics (also called semiotic studies) is the study of meaning-making, the study of sign process (semiosis) and meaningful communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Objects of discourse analysis can be defined in terms of <strong>coherent sequences</strong> of sentences, propositions, speech, or turns-at-talk. It studies language beyond the boundary of sentences and prefers to analyze naturally occuring language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Discourse analysis differs from text linguistics in that former aims at revealing socio-psychological characteristics of the person rather than the text structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Discourse Analysis includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dimensions of discourse</strong> such as sounds, gestures, syntax, lexicon, style, rhetoric, meanings, speech acts, moves, strategies, turns, and other aspects of interaction.</li>
