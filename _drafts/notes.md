### Discourse Analysis

Discourse Analysis or discourse studies is a general term used for a number of approaches used to analyze written, vocal, or sign language use, or any semiotic event.

> Semiotics (also called semiotic studies) is the study of meaning-making, the study of sign process (semiosis) and meaningful communication.

Objects of discourse analysis can be defined in terms of **coherent sequences** of sentences, propositions, speech, or turns-at-talk. It studies language beyond the boundary of sentences and prefers to analyze naturally occuring language.

> Discourse analysis differs from text linguistics in that former aims at revealing socio-psychological characteristics of the person rather than the text structure.

Discourse Analysis includes:

* **Dimensions of discourse** such as sounds, gestures, syntax, lexicon, style, rhetoric, meanings, speech acts, moves, strategies, turns, and other aspects of interaction.
* **Genres of discourse**: various types of discourse in politics, media, education, science etc.
* Relation between **discourse and syntactic structure**.
* Relation between **text and context**.
* Relation between **discourse and power**.
* Relation between **discourse and interaction**.
* Relation between **discourse and cognition and memory**.
